Welcome to the Linux (Debian 12) Network Info Fetcher.

This program will:

- Fetch public authentication/encryption types from currently connected network using ncmli.

This program is written in C# and when built, creates a natively executable filetype for Linux (run like so: ./Shortcutter). 
So no .dll file and no requirement for dotnet installation.
